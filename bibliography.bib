	abstract     = {Sparv is Språkbanken's corpus annotation pipeline infrastructure. The easiest way to use the pipeline is from its web interface with a plain text document. The pipeline uses in-house and external tools on the text to segment it into sentences and paragraphs, tokenise, tag parts-of-speech, look up in dictionaries and analyse compounds. The pipeline can also be run using a web API with XML results, and it is run locally at Språkbanken to prepare the documents in Korp, our corpus search tool. While the most sophisticated support is for modern Swedish, the pipeline supports 15 languages.},

@inProceedings{kokkinakis:2014, title = {HFST-SweNER . A New NER Resource for Swedish}, abstract = {Named entity recognition (NER) is a knowledge-intensive information extraction task that is used for recognizing textual mentions of entities that belong to a predefined set of categories, such as locations, organizations and time expressions. NER is a challenging, difficult, yet essential preprocessing technology for many natural language processing applications, and particularly crucial for language understanding. NER has been actively explored in academia and in industry especially during the last years due to the advent of social media data. This paper describes the conversion, modeling and adaptation of a Swedish NER system from a hybrid environment, with integrated functionality from various processing components, to the Helsinki Finite-State Transducer Technology (HFST) platform. This new HFST-based NER (HFST-SweNER) is a full-fledged open source implementation that supports a variety of generic named entity types and consists of multiple, reusable resource layers, e.g., various n-gram-based named entity lists (gazetteers).}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 9th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), Reykjavik 26 - 31 May 2014.}, author = {Kokkinakis, Dimitrios and Niemi, Jyrki and hardwick, sam and Lindén, Krister and Borin, Lars}, year = {2014}, ISBN = {978-2-9517408-8-4}, pages = {2537--2543}, }
